*******************************************************************
* Front-end Developer & Web Designer - BUT, should be UI focused  *
* The UI stuff may actually have to take a BACK SEAT.             *
* Front-end developer + UI Designer = UI Developer                *
* No one uses the phrase "UI Developer".                          *
* UI Designer might be closer to where I want to be:              *
* More design-focused; which means better people...               *
* Really, what I want is the SOFT-SKILLS position!                *
* OR a Web Designer / Front-end Developer - also good             *
* Web Designer/Developer is a very good lead-in to UX             *
* Design
*******************************************************************

- "In many cases, the job of the web designer and front end developer are done by the same person in the company."
- The interface model really ought to be the same as the *user's* mental model - not the model of the engineer.
- "I've met engineers who were really great designers too" - Though this happens infrequently - because the motivation to do each is different.
- Web design - deals with the user.
- Web development - deals with the technology.
- UI design = smart workflow. More interactive. But can be pretty.
- Web design = pretty. More visual. But can be useful.
- "Experience in designing, marking up, and developing the UI of websites and/or web applications."
- Front-end development: "A mix of programming and layout that powers the visuals and interactions of the web."
- Likely not to get a UX designer position, because it requires leadership experience, and a stronger portfolio than what I have. Usually more experience also.
- Web developer - a backend person, not a front end person. - Though these terms are frequently interchangable.


****************************************************
Will need to know (needs to be prioritized):

***Goals:***
1. Develop confidence to do the job, day-to-day. Be competitive.
2. Develop a portfolio to show to employers.
3. Develop enough skills to pass interview questions.


***First step:***
Done. Get around 10 job descriptions of jobs I could *actually* get, and set up the learning base from there (with a maximum of two years experience required (preferably none)). -- Starting with the end in mind.
Get an idea of what projects I'll have to create, and a *timeline* for these!
Get books &/or online course material for this.
Decide on how much theory & learning I'll have to do. Figure out how much non-productive practicing I'll have to do.
   Will have to PLAY a LOT, with many of these technologies and concepts. This will be fun, and a helpful learning experience. Most of my days can be spent playing actually.
     - Front-end skills/technologies.
     - Design skills.
     - Touch on some UX stuff (though likely not super important).


***Coursework:***
   GitHub version control - to practice source control and show portfolio.
   Design knowledge & practice - Will end up practicing these skills throughout the rest of the learning.
      InDesign
      Dreamweaver
      Wireframes
      Web-design standards (slicing, .psd files, etc).
      Typography
      Information Heirarchy
      Data Visualization
      image optimization, palette reduction techniques and animation
      Dimensions/resolutions (including those for mobile & tablet)
      Iterate through a number of different design concepts - Look at other sites for inspiration. Try to break out of the standard whitespace if possible (but not too crazy - I still want a job). 
      .psd slicing
      Leverage animation effects, jquery, css3, html5, etc. in the designs (make the designs somewhat focused on these things).

      Get a few design techniques - "In my bag" so to speak - some things that I can do easily, and whip out when necessary.
         Just go through a number of the popular designs right now, and copy what they do. Can do a number of tutorials here also.
         Familiarize self with different libraries of design tools available as well.

   User-centered design principles, methods, practices. UI/UX best practices.
      Rapid prototyping skills - Axure, Visio
   HTML5 & CSS3, Front-end coding standards/conventions
      CSS media queries
   SEO design & standards
   JavaScript, Jquery, Jquery mobile, Firebug - Object oriented stuff here.
   Content Management Systems, Relational Databases, SQL & MySQL practice
   ***Responsive Design, Mobile, Tablets (uses JQuery/JavaScript) - Very important. Maybe even do earlier!
   PHP, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET (PHP is supposedly getting replaced by ASP.NET)
   Debugging different web browsers, broswer compatibility. "Degrades gracefully in older browsers."
   Bootstrap, wordpress, & other templates
   Google analytics
   Finish sites, get critiques, test on multiple browsers and devices.
   Play with, and touch on *all* the other points - get a verrry limited working knowledge of the rest (in case I need them later).
      SASS
      HAML
      Flash/actionscript
      Coffeescript, Clojurescript
      Drupal
      Google Web Toolkit
   Learn basic backend concepts - learn C# in-depth more, 
      MVC architecture
      Database abstraction layers
      Operate a CLI


* One whole site should be finished by the time the coursework is done - this way I get a lot of good practice while learning.
* The next site will help to reinforce the skills just learned, and will help committ to memory.
* The final site will be used to fill in gaps, should be somewhat "perfect", and should give me to confidence to go out and interview.


***3 Projects:***
   Portfolio/introduction microsite - can be designer-friendly central!
   Site for paintings - This one is good for getting my feet wet.
   MVC web application - This one may actually by my selling point.
   Dynamic, consumer website - catch-all for all the other things I'll be doing - needs to be better fleshed-out/understood.
      Can re-do a website (like MRI's website).
      This should be targeted at a specific kind of job...
      This one is for practicing all the advanced concepts, and allowing me to show that I can do other things (may turn out to be a baddd idea...).






Should have increased focus on the UX & Design parts - these will get me the *correct* job. The front-end skills are really more of a fall-back... - I have since changed my position on this.
   I'm applying for a soft-skills position - make sure my resume reflects that!

Front-end skills should be limited to:
User-centered design principles, methods, and practices.
Firm grasp of popular UI patterns - What are popular UI patterns?
Basic knowledge of interaction design.
The below are referred to as "interactive technologies"
HTML5 (Maybe XHTML? DHTML? - What is this?) - Strong to excellent in this and the below.
CSS3 (Maybe XCSS?)
JavaScript
JQuery
JQuery mobile
SQL
PHP - (PHPS?)
(Possibly flash, actionscript)
Responsive sites - a biggg one that I see a lot.
   This is for the Dev / Designer position (which may also be a good fit (if I can find it)).
"Understanding of the SDLC"
SEO-aware design approach



Maybe:
AngularJS
FTP Clients - "Internet related application"
Performance testing
PHP - Many times
AJAX - "Working knowledge of..."
RSS
XSLT
XML

Bootstrap - seen a number of times. Unsure of its importance.
Accessability - get a rough knowledge of this now.
Content Management Systems, Templates
Familiar with unit testing, design patterns, and component lifecycle development.
Mobile design best practices.
Git or GitHub version control. - 3+ times
"Ability to generate well factored code." - Seen once.

"Light back-end work" - Can say "Experience with C#, ASP.NET, MVC"
"User-driven templates"
User acceptance testing
"Experience with desktop publishing software, such as QuarkXPress, is a plus.?"

Anything else is extra..., and outside the scope of the job description.

All more important than programming skills!:
Ability to create *?clickable flows?* in addition to traditional wires, sitemaps, etc.
site maps, user scenarios, wireframes, mental models, personas, interaction specifications, and prototypes) 

Probably general graphic design skills will be more helpful than front-end skills!
   - Showing some good interface layouts, is probably a lottt more desirable.

Learn to write all the above accross browsers
Become familiar with the different "frameworks".
Wireframe, lo-fi mockups, ang layout a website & web application.
Usability evaluation methods - do some AB testing.
Manage a domains DNS settings. Understand ips & the like.
Learn & use sourcecontrol with GIT.
   - Use the GIT command line.
In-browser development tools - learn to use them fully.
Mobile development.
Motion/rich media (like flash) development. Animated GIFs.
Web & mobile standards and best practices. - "Isobar frontend code standards."

****************************************************
Notes:

Will have to create a *number* of projects in order to practice all the skills necessary.
Buy hosting - this will help incredibly with the development process.

Create a few different websites:
Have one splash page that links to them all. Have links to the source code & process files for those sites as well.
Explain on the splash page the features of the sites (such as responsive design, mobile compatibility, etc).
At least one of the sites should be a web *application* - and not just a website.
For fun - create a little game, using animations, HTML5, and JS.
Put a version of that graphic from the new on my LinkedIN.

With around 10 years of experience in Adobe Creative Suite, years of visual skills (my designers /eye/), a fundamental programming core, and a talent for writing clean, efficient code, I will be blah blah blah...
Interactive, functional design. Empathy. Emphasis on the user. Knowledge of languages below:...
Experience with information architecture, usability testing, craft a pleasing and intuitive user expereience, that will keep your clients coming back for more!
Exceptional communication & organizational skills, I have the professionalism to interact directly with your clients, as well as the technical knowledge to work with the engineers.
"Passion for software", Highly curious and constantly learning.
Experience viewing dozens of websites and an intuitive feel for using many kinds.
Curious about technology - a self starter who is constantly learning.

Web design - a less desirable career path because it is *fiercly competitive* - though this may actually be a positive for me. The pay is also somewhat lower.
Still, this is much better than being in the hell envioronment that is back-end.

Closer to information architecture, than to front-end development.

The job I'm looking for may also be more of a "mixed-bag" sort of deal as well.

Originally thinking front-end as a way into UX - WRONG! This will be very trying for me - having to sit with all the science nerds day-after-day will become excruciating...

Will be much closer with web-design, than with front-end dev.
   - Could of course do both, but since I will already have the front-end skills, should just focus more on the web-design skills.

I am about in the same place with UI as I was with software development:
"Good at math." - A tangental skill, but not necessarily the correct one.

Marketable types of companies:
technology consulting, or interactive agency

"Wanted to be in software, but something more towards the User/Information Architecture side of things (the soft-skills side)."

"Code is not a core skill of a UX designer."

"Enterprise graphic design." - May be in opposition to "Mobile graphic design".

The ideal job I'm searching for:
   - Designing actual user interfaces (HI-FI designs).
   - Coding those designs, doing some front-end dev.
   - In a more independent role (rather than being directly on the agile floor).
   - Pays reasonably well.
   - Makes good use of my well-rounded skill set.
   - Either a very small company, or a very big one (preferably the latter).

The User Experience Consultant is responsible for developing interaction and information architecture deliverables (such as, site maps, user scenarios, wireframes, mental models, personas, interaction specifications, and prototypes) for a variety of user interfaces including web sites, mobile applications, kiosks and business tools. 

UX/interaction design is kind of like the marketing department for the product development team.

Job search (will need to create a todo for this):
Kent board
Kent office
CIA board
CIA office
Online job sites
LinkedIN networking (once my profile is updated)

Other job titles (in a roughly desirable order) - UX designer, Interaction designer, Interactive designer, Product designer, UI designer, UI artist (videogame industry), UI developer, Web designer, digital designer, Enterprise graphic design, mobile graphic design, graphic design, Web developer, front-end developer, user experience professional, Web producer, Multimedia designer (keyword "multimedia" not the most important; also not that many jobs anyways...)

***Apply to front-end web dev jobs just to see if they are a fit - if on-site, I find that the people suck, I can always leave later...

They jobs that state designer, can often be UX jobs in disguise!
Look a lot!!! Some of the "dream jobs" aren't on the first page - or even have the correct titles!

Keywords: Front end, ui ux, multimedia, interactive, 


***Note: Web developer will likely be the easiest (and highest paying) job to get. Try to find one with a UI and/or design flair!

Graphic Design Theory

The discipline of graphic design works at many levels, from the surface effect to the core basics of layout and spacing.

I really believe that the core basics are far more important than the “higher” aspects.

The core basics include:

    Spacing
    Proportion and Balance
    Grouping
    Contrast and Colour
    Flow, and managing the Eye

These basics make a design basically work. Get them right, and your design will be effective, irrespective of the finish.

At the higher end, you’ve got the actual surface layer, which sits on top of the basic structure. These skills include:

    Typography
    3D effects
    Custom imagery
    Plus all the basic factors – applied together and to a finer degree
    and all the stylistic web design tricks we know and love.

Get both right, and you can have a compelling web page design that works on every level. Get the basics right, and your page will be fundamentally effective. Get just the surface finish, and you could end up with no result at all, other than the accolades of design tossers, which really is the wooden spoon.
